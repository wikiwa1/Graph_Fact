# Graph Factorization and Intermediate Subfactors

Here you will find the tools used in [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.00227) to determine the graph factorization of the 4-star $S(3,3,3,3)$. The factorization into *building blocks* are done in `graph_fact.py` using the tools in `graph_fact_tools.py` and saved in `result.pkl`. 

If you only need to see all the possible norms for intermediate subfactors, load `result.pkl` in `graph_norms.ipynb` and execute all cells. A table with all the norms will be produced at the end.
